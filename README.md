# Random-Password-Generator

## What does this do?
Given a set of decisions based on the user, clicking the red 'Generate Password' button will display a randomly generated password onto the screen. 

The user can select the following choices to include into their randomly generated password:
    - the addition of special characters (e.g. @#!&%).
    - the addition of number values (e.g. 1234).
    - the addition of uppercase characters (e.g. ABCD).
    - the addition of lowercase characters (e.g. abcd).
